# GGJ2021
This is my version of a game for Global Game Jam that I was messing with (not the uploaded one).

For my team, a different version of the game was uploaded to Global Game Jam.

For the version that I was testing:

-I learned about getting clear sprites with clean lines, and tilemapping.
Also, I learned about animating sprites, but not how to implement them in the game.

-I used a bunch of resources to understand how the animations work, Google searches and all of that.
Many were for different versions and it was difficult to look for all the features without searching
for each of them individually.

Movement:

The controller script for the character is from Brackeys, and the specific YouTube video I got it from is:

Link for the project relating to the 2D Movement by Brackeys is here:

What I would like to do/learn for future games:

-Learn how to have sprites animated during movement.
-Collecting items.
